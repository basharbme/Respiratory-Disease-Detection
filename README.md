## Applied Machine Learning for Affective Computing – Respiratory Disease Detection Project

### Description
Using the dataset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/respiratory-sound-database#patient_diagnosis.csv), we train a Convolutional Neural Network to detect the following respiratory diseases from audio of patients' breathing:
- Asthma
- COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder)
- LRTI (Lower Respiratory Tract Infection)
- URTI (Upper Respiratory Tract Infection)
- Bronchiectasis
- Bronchiolitis
- Pneumonia
